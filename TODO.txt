TODO list
Color Walk Editor (not the game)
1. Develop a editor for touchable objects.
1.1. Extend Touchable.java to allow for animations.
1.2. Export sprite sheets at various scales for corona SDK
	* Also add check to make sure images are not already scaled
2. Allow for creating new level projects.
	* Currently I have to relaunch the application to create a clean editor space.
3. Check file names for invalid characters.
4. Show file path where files are saved to and exported.
5. Show error dialog when images not found.

Color Walk
1. Extend Touchable.lua to allow for animations
1.1. Add support for varying resolutions.
3. Investigate creating a "page" object.
	* Currently the editor creates a scene for each page. Seems redundant but maybe best solution.
