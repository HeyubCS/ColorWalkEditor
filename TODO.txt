TODO list
Color Walk Editor (not the game)
1. Save next level variable with level data.
	* Currently the nextLevel is not saved and must be changed every time a level is loaded into the editor.
1.1. Research exporting and scaling images in Java.
1.2. Export images at various lower resolutions.
	* Currently the scaling ratio is very high, causing odd visual effects.
2. Allow for creating new level projects.
	* Currently I have to relaunch the application to create a clean editor space.
3. Check file names for invalid characters.
4. Show file path where files are saved to and exported.
5. Show error dialog when images not found.
6. Add functionality to add to the object list.
7. Extend Touchable.java to allow for animations.

Color Walk
1. Extend Touchable.lua to allow for animations
1.1. Add support for varying resolutions.
2. Change Touchable to not include a listener.
	* This should be the responsibility of the scene.
3. Investigate creating a "page" object.
	* Currently the editor creates a scene for each page. Seems redundant but maybe best solution.
