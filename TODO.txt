TODO list
Color Walk Editor (not the game)
1. Fix saving levels within the editor.
	* I broke this when I removed rotation and scale from the editor.
2. Allow for creating new level projects.
	* Currently I have to relaunch the application to create a clean editor space.
3. Check file names for invalid characters.
4. Show file path where files are saved to and exported.
5. Show error dialog when images not found.
6. Add functionality to add to the object list.
7. Extend Touchable.java to allow for animations.

Color Walk
1. Create a scene object for pages.
	*Currently one scene is behaving as all scenes.
2. Extend Touchable.lua to allow for animations
